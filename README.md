# ReVanced Documentation

Instructions to build and install ReVanced.

# Manager

Revanced Manager is now in public Alpha, so it is recommended that you try to use that [here instead](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/tag/v0.0.14). However, if you'd prefer to use the command-line application, or the manager doesn't work for you, feel free to continue.
